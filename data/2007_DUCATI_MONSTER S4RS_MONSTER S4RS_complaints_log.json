      "complaintNumber": 1,
      "issueCategory": "Plastic Fuel Tank Expansion and Deformation",
      "impact": "The expansion and deformation of the plastic fuel tank can cause the tank to become dislodged from the frame, leading to fuel leaks, and potentially resulting in a fire or explosion. Additionally, the tank's movement can interfere with the steering and ignition systems, causing safety concerns.",
      "symptoms": [
        "The fuel tank is expanding and deforming",
        "causing it to not sit properly in the frame",
        "the handlebars to hit it on turning",
        "and it to press against the ignition switch. The tank's latch is difficult to open and close",
        "and the rubber mounts no longer sit on the frame."

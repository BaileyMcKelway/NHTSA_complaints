      "issueCategory": "Radiator Mounting Bracket Failure",
      "impact": "The failure of the radiator mounting bracket can cause the radiator to leak, leading to extremely hot coolant spraying onto the rider's leg, potentially causing burns or injuries. Additionally, the leaked fluid can compromise the integrity of the contact between the rear tire and the road, increasing the risk of a crash.",
